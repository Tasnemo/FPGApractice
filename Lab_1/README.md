## Sequential Logic Latch

| TRIGGER | INPUT | What happens to OUT when INPUT changes? |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0      | 0 → 1  |                                         |
| 0      | 1 → 0  |                                         |
| 0 → 1  | 0      |                                         |
| 0 → 1  | 1      |                                         |
| 1      | 0 → 1  |                                         |
| 1      | 1 → 0  |                                         |
| 1 → 0  | 0      |                                         |
| 1 → 0  | 1      |                                         |


## Sequential Logic D-Flip Flop

| CLOCK | D | What happens to Q when D changes? |
|-------|---|-----------------------------------|
| 0     | 0 → 1 |                               |
| 0     | 1 → 0 |                               |
| 0 → 1 | 0     |                               |
| 0 → 1 | 1     |                               |
| 1     | 0 → 1 |                               |
| 1     | 1 → 0 |                               |
| 1 → 0 | 0     |                               |
| 1 → 0 | 1     |                               |

**What is different about the input/output operation of the D-Latch versus the D-Flip Flop?**

**Can you think of any ways the D-Flip Flop might be more useful than the Latch?**
